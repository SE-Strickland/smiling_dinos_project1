Project 1 for BSC6451 Computational Tools Class - Fall 2024

This repository contains a script that allows you to use data from the NIH GenBank (National Library of Medicine).

In this sense, the following script allows you to use files in FASTA format that contain the database of genetic sequences of a particular species and return the following results:

- Length of the genetic base sequence
- Projection of scatter plots, treeMap, and dendrograms
- An alert message in those cases where the data sequence contains null information (N)
- Finding of opening reading frame

The team members are:

- Mayu Katafuchi
- Bharti Parihar
- Fabian Romero
- Sarah Ellen Strickland
